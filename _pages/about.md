I am a physician and computational health scientist at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://psych.ucsf.edu/), where I am 
affiliated with the [Psychiatry RRTP](https://psych.ucsf.edu/rtp/research) and the [Clinical Informatics Fellowship](https://clinicalinformaticsfellowship.ucsf.edu/). 
I founded the UCSF AI in Mental Health Research Group [(AIMHealth)](https://aimhealth.ucsf.edu/). I am also co-founder 
and Chief Technology Officer at [SimX](https://simxvr.com). Previously, I was mentored by [Atul Butte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Butte) at UCSF and by [Corey Arnold](https://www.coreyarnold.dev/) 
at UCLA. At UCSF, I work with the UCSF [Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences](https://psych.ucsf.edu), the [Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute](https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/), 
and the [Division of Clinical Informatics and Digital Transformation](https://docit.ucsf.edu/).

At UCSF, my research focuses on the development of novel artificial intelligence techniques for clinical
applications, with a focus on using large language models to interpret patient and clinical text, perform clinical
reasoning, and assist in the delivery of clinical care. I am also studying how the use of consumer-facing 
AI chatbots interactions with mental illness, with a particular interest in the phenomenon described in the media as 
"AI-associated psychosis." In collaboration with colleagues at the [Stanford Brainstorm](https://www.stanfordbrainstorm.com/) 
group, I'm working to develop methods for measuring and simulating these interactions.

At SimX, I lead technology strategy. Previously, I led the company's advanced development division, which focused on next-generation
technology projects in artificial intelligence and extended reality. I also founded our internal modeling and simulation
research laboratory, the Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness (VALOR) Program. Prior to the
acquisition of the company by [Madison Industries](https://madison.net/), I served as Principal Investigator for our $20M+ extramurally 
funded research program aimed at improving the art and science of virtual medical simulation training.

I am also a member of the House of Delegates of
the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/house-delegates) (AMA), where I represent the American
Psychiatric Association and am co-chair of the Informatics Caucus. I am also a member of the House of Delegates of
the [California Medical Association](https://www.cmadocs.org/My-CMA/Organizational-Structure/House-of-Delegates-Copy) (
CMA) and its Councils on Medical Service and Legislation. Previously, I was a member of the Board of Trustees of the AMA
and CMA, the [Butte Lab](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF, and the
UCLA [Biomedical AI Research Lab](https://bair.seas.ucla.edu/). I am a [Fellow](https://amia.org/communities/famia) of the American Medical Informatics Association.

I received my MD PhD from UCLA, and my BS (Hons) from the California Institute of Technology. I currently live in San
Francisco, CA and am a native of Chicago, IL.
