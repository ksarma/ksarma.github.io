I am co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at [SimX](https://simxvr.com). I am also a computational medical scientist and practicing clinical psychiatrist at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://psych.ucsf.edu/), where I work with Dr. [Atul Butte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Butte) and Dr. [Andrew Krystal](https://dolby.ucsf.edu/people/andrew-krystal-md). 

At UCSF, my research focuses on the development of novel artificial intelligence techniques for behavioral health applications, with a focus using large language models to interpret patient and clinical text, perform psychiatric reasoning, and assist in the delivery of clinical care.

At SimX, I lead technology strategy and the company's advanced development division, which focuses on next-generation technology projects in artificial intelligence and extended reality.  I also founded our internal modeling and simulation research laboratory, the Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness (VALOR) Program. Prior to the acquisition of the company by [Madison Industries](https://madison.net/), I served as Principal Investigator for our $20M+ extramurally funded research program aimed at improving the art and science of virtual medical simulation training.

I am also a member of the House of Delegates of the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/house-delegates) (AMA), where I represent the American Psychiatric Association. I am also a member of the House of Delegates of the [California Medical Association](https://www.cmadocs.org/My-CMA/Organizational-Structure/House-of-Delegates-Copy) (CMA) and its Councils on Medical Service and Legislation. Previously, I was a member of the Board of Trustees of the AMA and CMA, and a computational medical scientist at the UCLA [Biomedical AI Research Lab](https://bair.seas.ucla.edu/) where I worked with Dr. [Corey Arnold](https://www.coreyarnold.dev/).

I received my MD PhD from UCLA, and my BS (Hons) from the California Institute of Technology. I currently live in San Francisco, CA and am a native of Chicago, IL.
