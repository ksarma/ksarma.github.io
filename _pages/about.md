I am co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at [SimX](https://simxvr.com), and a computational medical scientist at the UCLA [Computational Diagnostics](https://cdx.seas.ucla.edu/) group. Previously, he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association and the California Medical Association.

At SimX, I lead the Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness (VALOR) program, a collaboration between industry, academia, and the US Government to develop and evaluate the next generation of medical simulation training across the spectrum of care.

At UCLA, my research focuses on the development of novel artificial intelligence techniques for medical applications, with a focus on methods for extracting, transforming, and learning using data extracted natively from clinical systems. 

I received my PhD in Bioengineering (Medical Imaging and Informatics) at UCLA, and my BS (Hons) in Computer Science from the California Institute of Technology. I currently live in Los Angeles, CA and am a native of Chicago, IL.
