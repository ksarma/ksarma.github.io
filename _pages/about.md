I am a computational health scientist and practicing clinical psychiatrist at
the [University of California, San Francisco](https://psych.ucsf.edu/), where I founded the UCSF AI in Mental Health
Research Group (AIMHealth). I am also co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at [SimX](https://simxvr.com). Previously,
I was mentored by [Atul Butte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Butte) at UCSF and
by [Corey Arnold](https://www.coreyarnold.dev/) at UCLA. I am affiliated with the
UCSF [Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences](https://psych.ucsf.edu) and
the [Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute](https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF.

At UCSF, my research focuses on the development of novel artificial intelligence techniques for clinical
applications, with a focus on using large language models to interpret patient and clinical text, perform clinical
reasoning, and assist in the delivery of clinical care. I have been involved in projects examining the psychiatric
knowledge base encoded in latest-generation LLMs, evaluating approaches for guided LLM reasoning in 
diagnosis, measuring the mental health impact and safety of LLM-based chatbots, developing new methods for using
LLM-based agents to interact with the electronic health record, and designing new systems for constraining LLMs to act
within acceptable clinical parameters across a wide variety of settings.

At SimX, I lead technology strategy and the company's advanced development division, which focuses on next-generation
technology projects in artificial intelligence and extended reality. I also founded our internal modeling and simulation
research laboratory, the Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness (VALOR) Program. Prior to the
acquisition of the company by [Madison Industries](https://madison.net/), I served as Principal Investigator for our $20M+ extramurally 
funded research program aimed at improving the art and science of virtual medical simulation training.

I am also a member of the House of Delegates of
the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/house-delegates) (AMA), where I represent the American
Psychiatric Association and am co-chair of the Informatics Caucus. I am also a member of the House of Delegates of
the [California Medical Association](https://www.cmadocs.org/My-CMA/Organizational-Structure/House-of-Delegates-Copy) (
CMA) and its Councils on Medical Service and Legislation. Previously, I was a member of the Board of Trustees of the AMA
and CMA, the [Butte Lab](https://buttelab.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF, and the
UCLA [Biomedical AI Research Lab](https://bair.seas.ucla.edu/).

I received my MD PhD from UCLA, and my BS (Hons) from the California Institute of Technology. I currently live in San
Francisco, CA and am a native of Chicago, IL.
