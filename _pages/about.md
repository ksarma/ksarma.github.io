I am co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at [SimX](https://simxvr.com). I am also a computational medical scientist and practicing clinical psychiatrist at the [University of California, San Francisco](https://psych.ucsf.edu/). 

At UCSF, my research focuses on the development of novel artificial intelligence techniques for medical applications, with a focus on methods for extracting, transforming, and learning using data extracted from clinical systems.

Previously, I was a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association and the California Medical Association, and a computational medical scientist at the UCLA [Computational Diagnostics](https://cdx.seas.ucla.edu/) group.

At SimX, I founded the Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness (VALOR) program, a Federally funded collaboration between industry, academia, and the US Government to develop, evaluate and sustain the next generation of medical simulation training across the spectrum of care.

I received my MD PhD from UCLA, and my BS (Hons) from the California Institute of Technology. I currently live in San Francisco, CA and am a native of Chicago, IL.
