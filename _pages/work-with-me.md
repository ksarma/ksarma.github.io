# Research Collaboration
I am always interested in exploring new research collaborations at the interaction of artificial intelligence and 
mental health. If your work intersects with ours at the [UCSF AI in Mental Health Research Group (AIMHealth)](https://aimhealth.ucsf.edu/),
please feel free to reach out to me directly at karthik.sarma (at) ucsf.edu or to our group contact at aimhealth (at) 
ucsf.edu.

# Academic Mentorship
I am not currently able to take on new primary mentee graduate students or postdocs, but I may be able to provide
co-mentorship to students mentored by a primary faculty member. For students in this position, it may be possible for you
to join one of our ongoing projects or take on one of our project opportunities. If you are interested in working with me 
in this capacity, please reach out with a CV and a brief description of your research interests and background.

# Academic-Industry Partnerships
Through UCSF [AIMHealth](https://aimhealth.ucsf.edu/), I am able to facilitate research-based academic-industry 
partnerships. If your company is interested in working with us on a relevant clinical trial, technology development project,
SBIR/STTR (or similar) grant, or other collaboration, please feel free to contact me directly.

# Speaking Enagements
I do consider invitations for speaking engagements on topics related to my expertise. Generally, I expect such 
invitations to cover travel expenses (unless remote) and an honorarium, but for academic, non-profit, or early-stage 
ventures, I may consider otherwise. If you are interested in inviting me to speak at your event, please feel free to
contact me directly.

# Consulting
I maintain a limited consulting practice, generally focused on technology and entreprenurship strategy advising, for
companies using innovative healthcare-related technologies. For this practice, I draw on my experience as a technologist, 
founder, and behavioral health provider.  I also consider expert witness engagements related specifically to technology 
and the intersection between technology, health, and behavioral health. If you are interested in engaging me, please
reach out to me at ksarma (at) ksarma.com.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I am not currently accepting engagements (consulting or expert) that relate *only* 
to clinical expertise (i.e., clinical annotation, forensic psychiatry, locums, etc.), nor am I accepting offers of full-time
employment.
